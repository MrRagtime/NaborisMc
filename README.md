# NaborisMc
NaborisMc is a multi-functional fork of [DivineMC](https://github.com/BX-Team/DivineMC) which focuses on the optimization of your server. 

A duel project in collaboration with No Collision, NaborisMc will include the sane patches and features from [CollisionMc](https://github.com/No-Collision/CollisionMc) except incompatibility Folia Features that break most plugins. This software is meant for those who want our low-player optimizations without replacing or removing your favorite plugins. If you have plugins that already work and are compatible with Folia, than we recommend using CollisionMc!
